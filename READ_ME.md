# Welcome to World of PHPcraft!

World of PHPcraft is written in Node.js. I spent way too much time trying to set up my PHP environment so I switched to Node. 
Sometimes that's just how it is.

## To-do:
* Change chat so that location plays a role: yell (all locations), say (same location), tell (whisper/PM by name)
* Move actions from URL to chat
* Scale up dungeon size and adjust for more players

## Where can I access this?
Technically via https://world-of-phpcraft.herokuapp.com/
